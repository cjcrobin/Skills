# Write Tech Article Skill

This skill transforms markdown source files (containing articles, HN discussions, documentation) into comprehensive, naturally-written Chinese blog posts following a specific structure.

## Core Capabilities

- Accept multiple markdown files as input sources
- Analyze content types via frontmatter metadata (type field)
- Generate structured blog articles with frontmatter metadata
- Produce natural Chinese writing without AI-style language
- Support multiple article structures and templates
- Save to user-specified locations

## Input Requirements

**Source files must be markdown format** generated by the `html-to-markdown` skill with:

### File Structure
After using `html-to-markdown` on aggregate-news output, you'll have:
```
[slug]/
  ├── origin.json          # Original structured data
  ├── post.md             # Hacker News: article content
  ├── comment.md          # Hacker News: HN discussion
  ├── product.md          # Product Hunt: product page
  └── hunt.md             # Product Hunt: PH launch page
```

### Source File Combinations

**Hacker News:**
- Use `post.md` (required) - original article content
- Use `comment.md` (optional) - HN discussion for community insights

**Product Hunt:**
- Use `product.md` (required) - official product page
- Use `hunt.md` (optional) - PH launch page for community feedback

**For file handling details, see [SOURCE_HANDLING.md](references/SOURCE_HANDLING.md)**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Input

Ask the user for:
1. **Source directory or markdown files** (required):
   - Option A: Directory path containing `origin.json` and markdown files (e.g., `moltbook/`)
   - Option B: Individual markdown files from the directory
     - Hacker News: `post.md` (required), `comment.md` (optional)
     - Product Hunt: `product.md` (required), `hunt.md` (optional)
2. **Additional context** (optional): Any specific angles or topics to emphasize

**Note**: Source files must be prepared using the `html-to-markdown` skill first. The skill expects the new file structure: `[slug]/origin.json` and source-specific markdown files.

### Step 2: Load Preferences

Check for preferences in this order:
1. `{SKILL_ROOT}/PREFERENCE.md` (project-level)
2. `~/.copilot/skills/write-tech-article/PREFERENCE.md` (user-level)
3. If neither exists, prompt user and create `{SKILL_ROOT}/PREFERENCE.md`

Required preferences:
- **output_directory**: Where to save generated articles (e.g., `~/articles/published`)
- **default_category**: Default category tag (e.g., `hacknews-daily`)
- **author**: Author name for metadata (optional)
- **language**: Output language (default: `zh-CN`)
- **writing_style**: Writing style/perspective (default: `objective`, options: `objective`, `first-person`)

See [PREFERENCE_TEMPLATE.md](PREFERENCE_TEMPLATE.md) for complete example.

### Step 3: Read and Parse Source Files

Read all provided markdown files based on source type:

**Hacker News:**
- Read `post.md` (required)
- Read `comment.md` (optional)

**Product Hunt:**
- Read `product.md` (required)
- Read `hunt.md` (optional)

Parse frontmatter and extract markdown content from each file.

### Step 4: Analyze and Structure

Analyze the markdown content from all source files:
- Extract core topics and key insights
- Identify technical details and examples
- Gather community perspectives (if available)
- Note real-world experiences and feedback

**Apply article structure** (see [ARTICLE_STRUCTURE.md](references/ARTICLE_STRUCTURE.md)):
1. Frontmatter (YAML metadata)
2. Article summary (摘要)
3. Background and problem (背景与问题)
4. Core content analysis (核心内容解析)
5. Deep analysis and reflection (深度分析与思考)
6. Tech stack/tools (技术栈/工具清单)
7. Related resources (相关资源)

### Step 5: Generate Article

**Critical: Writing Style Selection**

Choose the appropriate writing style based on user preference or content type:

**Objective Style (Default):**
- Use for formal, technical articles
- Third-person perspective
- Direct, clear statements without personal references
- Follow [WRITING_STYLE_OBJECTIVE.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_OBJECTIVE.md)

**First-Person Style:**
- Use when user requests personal perspective
- Include personal experiences and learning journey
- Share mistakes and problem-solving process
- Follow [WRITING_STYLE_FIRST_PERSON.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_FIRST_PERSON.md)

**Ask the user** which style they prefer if not specified in PREFERENCE.md.

**Generation Process:**
1. Select appropriate writing style
2. Extract key facts and technical details
3. Organize into logical flow per ARTICLE_STRUCTURE.md
4. Write each section with natural language
5. Include code examples with proper formatting
6. Add technical depth where relevant
7. Cite sources and provide links

### Step 6: Format and Save

1. Generate filename from article title (slugified)
2. Add YAML frontmatter with metadata:
   - title, date, tags, categories
   - description (50-200 words)
   - slug (URL-friendly identifier)
3. Format markdown with proper headings, lists, code blocks
4. Save to: `{output_directory}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{slug}.md`

Example path: `~/articles/published/2026-01-30/claude-code-daily-benchmarks.md`

### Step 7: Verify and Report

1. Verify file was created successfully
2. Show user:
   - File location
   - Word count
   - Structure completeness checklist
3. Ask if any revisions needed

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, ensure the article has:
- [ ] Clear, specific title (not generic)
- [ ] Comprehensive 3-5 sentence summary
- [ ] Well-defined problem/background section
- [ ] At least 5-7 key insights
- [ ] Technical examples or code where relevant
- [ ] Practical application scenarios
- [ ] Natural Chinese without AI clichés
- [ ] Proper source attribution
- [ ] Complete frontmatter metadata

## Important Notes

### Writing Style is Critical

The most important aspect of this skill is producing **natural Chinese writing** in the appropriate style:

**Objective Style** ([WRITING_STYLE_OBJECTIVE.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_OBJECTIVE.md)):
- Direct, clear statements without personal references
- Avoid AI-style clichés and formulaic phrases
- Use concrete examples before abstract concepts
- Vary sentence structure and length
- Write as if explaining to a technical colleague

**First-Person Style** ([WRITING_STYLE_FIRST_PERSON.md](references/WRITING_STYLE_FIRST_PERSON.md)):
- Share personal experiences and learning journey
- Include problem-solving process and mistakes
- Use conversational but professional tone
- Balance personal narrative with technical accuracy

### Source File Handling

When working with multiple source files:
- **Hacker News**: Use post.md + comment.md (if available)
- **Product Hunt**: Use product.md + hunt.md (if available)
- Combine content from all files following ARTICLE_STRUCTURE.md
- Attribute community perspectives clearly

**For file combinations, see [SOURCE_HANDLING.md](references/SOURCE_HANDLING.md)**

### Content Quality

Generate comprehensive articles (3500-5500 words) with:
- Original analysis, not just summarization
- Technical depth with code examples
- Practical applications and use cases
- Critical perspective (pros AND cons)
- Proper source attribution

### Metadata Accuracy

Ensure frontmatter is accurate:
- `date`: Use current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `title`: Specific, not generic (15-25 Chinese chars)
- `tags`: 5-8 relevant technical tags
- `description`: Compelling 50-200 word summary
- `slug`: URL-friendly identifier
- `categories`: From user preferences

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Can't find PREFERENCE.md
**Solution**: Prompt user for output_directory and create file

**Issue**: Source files missing frontmatter
**Solution**: Prompt user to use `html-to-markdown` skill first or manually add frontmatter

**Issue**: Content is too short
**Solution**: Expand analysis sections, add more examples, include community insights

**Issue**: Writing sounds too "AI-like"
**Solution**: Review appropriate writing style guide (WRITING_STYLE_OBJECTIVE.md or WRITING_STYLE_FIRST_PERSON.md), use more concrete examples, vary sentence structure

**Issue**: Missing technical details
**Solution**: Re-read source files, extract code examples, add implementation specifics

**Issue**: Unclear which writing style to use
**Solution**: Ask user for preference, check PREFERENCE.md for default style setting
